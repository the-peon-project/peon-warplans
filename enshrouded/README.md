# Peon War Plan - Enshrouded

The PEON war plan that Peon uses to deploy your game server.

> **The official Enshrouded server is Windows only. As such, the plan has been built on top of a steamcmd+winehq container**

## Stand-alone Use

This recipe can be used without the wider PEON project components.

### Guide

For this guide, please make sure you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com.zh.xy2401.com/v17.12/compose/install/) installed and running.

1. Download this folder and its contents.
2. Create a file `docker-compose.yml` in the directory with the contents as below.
3. Ensure that any scripts in the directory (i.e. `server_start`, `init_custom`) are executable by the docker user.
    ```bash
    chown 1000:1000 server_start
    chmod u+x server_start
    ```
4. Start the server. You can now start the server with the following command `docker-compose up -d`/`docker compose up -d`. You can then follow the deployment using `docker-compose logs -f`

#### docker-compose.yml

You can change any of the settings according to your needs.
