## Settings

> TODO - Add simple description of all server settings

### Server World Files

You can get your world files in `./peon/servers/[game_uid]/[server_name]/config`

- If you wish to customise the default servers, log into your host (running Peon) and run ``peon``.
- Alternatively, you should be able to edit the server files in the data/config directory of the server (e.g. ``./peon/servers/[game_uid]/[server_name]/``)
- Logging can be found in ``/var/log/peon/[game_uid].[server_name]/logs``, if required.

## Support the Project

PEON is an open-source project that I am working on in my spare time (for fun).
However, if you still wish to say thanks, feel free to pick up a virtual coffee for me at Ko-fi.
