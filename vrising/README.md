## Stand-alone Use

This recipe can be used without the wider PEON project components.

### Guide

For this guide, please make sure you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com.zh.xy2401.com/v17.12/compose/install/) installed and running.

1. Download this folder and its contents.
2. Create a file `docker-compose.yml` in the directory with the contents as below.
3. Ensure that any scripts in the directory (i.e. `server_start`, `init_custom`) are executable by the docker user.
    ```bash
    chown 1000:1000 server_start
    chmod u+x server_start
    ```
4. Start the server. You can now start the server with the following command `docker-compose up -d`/`docker compose up -d`. You can then follow the deployment using `docker logs --follow peon.warcamp.csgo.default`

#### docker-compose.yml

You can change any of the settings according to your needs.

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  server:
    container_name: peon.warcamp.vrising.${SERVERNAME}
    hostname: peon.steamcmd.vrising
    image: umlatt/steamcmd-winehq
    ports:
      - 9876:9876/udp
